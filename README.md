## Description

This API allows a user to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) from a MongoDB database.

The database will contain collections for Users and Thoughts.

When the server is started Mongoose models are synced to the Mongo database.

API GET routes will return data for Users and Thoughts in a formatted JSON.
    - Users will have a Friend count field
    - Thoughts will have a Reaction count field

API POST, PUT and DELETE routes will create, update and delete users and thoughts from the database.

There are also API POST and DELETE routes for creating and delete reactions to thoughts and for adding and removing friends from a user's friend list.

### Example

GET a single user route will return:

```
{
	"_id": "6274ec5bf718b019823eb4d9",
	"username": "Big Pooh Bear",
	"email": "bigpooh@fakemail.com",
	"thoughts": [
		"6274efdff718b019823eb4e2"
	],
	"friends": [
		"6272f0e6cf54fde1f558ed2b"
	],
	"__v": 0,
	"friendCount": 1,
	"id": "6274ec5bf718b019823eb4d9"
